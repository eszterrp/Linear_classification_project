# Extendend Project #2: Linear Classification
## Forest Cover Classification 

This project was created for my Computational Machine Learning and Computing for Data Science courses within the framework of my Data Science for Decision Making Masters' program at the Barcelona School of Economics. 

This repository contains my codes for our 2nd project for these courses. 

Contents:
1. **extended_classification_project_EP.ipynb**: It contains the script for the binary and multiclass classification problems.
2. **appendix.ipynb**: It contains some additional things: 
                          a. for different resampling strategies to handle class imbalance 
                          b. exploration of an extra classifier model: Decision Trees
                          c. exploration of ensemble techniques 
3. **linclass_my_functions.ipynb**: It contains my functions, that I created to make my life easier.
