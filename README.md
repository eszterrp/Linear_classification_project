# project-2_linear_classification
My scripts for the 2nd Extended Project about Linear Classification for the Computational Machine Learning and Computing for DS courses. 

Contents:
1. extended_classification_project_EP.ipynb: It contains the script for the binary and multiclass classification problems.
2. appendix.ipynb: It contains some additional things: 
                  a. for different resampling strategies to handle class imbalance 
                  b. exploration of an extra classifier model: Decision Trees
                  c. exploration of ensemble techniques 
3. linclass_my_functions.ipynb: It contains my functions, that I created to make my coding (life) easier.
